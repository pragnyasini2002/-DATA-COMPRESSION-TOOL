# MENTOR: NEELA SANTHOSH

# Project Overview: DATA COMPRESSION TOOL
# Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to design and implement basic data compression and decompression tools using the C programming language. These tools aim to reduce file sizes for storage efficiency and faster transmission, while ensuring that the original data can be perfectly reconstructed.

# Description:
Data compression is a critical aspect of data management, networking, and storage. This project involves developing a set of tools that implement popular lossless compression algorithms such as:

Run-Length Encoding (RLE)

Huffman Coding

Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW)

The tools will allow users to compress a file to save storage space and decompress it to retrieve the original data. C is chosen for its efficiency and close-to-hardware performance, making it suitable for performance-critical applications like compression.

# Key Features:
Modular Design: Separate modules/functions for each algorithm.

File Handling: Reading input files and writing compressed/decompressed files.

Performance Metrics: Display compression ratio, time taken.

Error Handling: Detection of invalid inputs or unsupported file formats.

# Tools & Technologies:
Programming Language: C

Compiler: GCC  Code:: Visual Studio Code 

Operating System: Windows / Linux

# Expected Outcomes:
A functional set of command-line tools to compress and decompress files.

Comparative analysis of compression efficiency among different algorithms.

A deeper understanding of how data compression algorithms work internally.

Well-documented source code with comments and usage instructions.
